# AuraLite OS Status Matrix

This document describes the current state of the repository. It is more current
than the historical 14-phase roadmap in `PLAN.md`.

Legend:

- ✅ **Implemented / exercised** — built by default and has a boot-time or
  host-side test path.
- 🧪 **Experimental** — code exists and may work in constrained scenarios, but
  semantics or coverage are incomplete.
- 🚧 **WIP / partial** — scaffolding or protocol code exists; full data path is
  not complete.
- ❌ **Not implemented** — no working support yet.

## Boot and CPU

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Limine ISO boot | ✅ | BIOS path is best-tested; UEFI files are included in the ISO. |
| Higher-half kernel | ✅ | Linked at `0xFFFFFFFF80100000`. |
| GDT / IDT / PIC | ✅ | 256 IDT gates, PIC IRQ remap. |
| TSS | ✅ | RSP0 + IST stack support. |
| SYSCALL/SYSRET | ✅ | Linux-like register ABI, custom syscall table. |
| SMP bring-up | 🧪 | APs are started and load tables, but they idle. Scheduler is not SMP-safe. |
| LAPIC / IOAPIC | ❌ | PIC/PIT are used instead. |

## Memory management

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Physical memory manager | ✅ | Bitmap over 4 KiB frames from Limine memmap. |
| Virtual memory manager | ✅ | Extends Limine page tables through HHDM. |
| Kernel heap | ✅ | First-fit allocator with coalescing. |
| Per-process PML4 | 🧪 | Implemented for spawned user processes. |
| Copy-on-write | ❌ | `fork` deep-copies user pages. |
| User pointer validation | 🧪 | `validate_user_range`, `copy_from_user`, `copy_to_user` are used by syscall dispatch; not yet a fault-recovering uaccess layer. |
| Slab allocator | ❌ | Future work. |

## Scheduling and processes

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Kernel threads | ✅ | 16 KiB kernel stacks. |
| Preemptive round-robin | ✅ | PIT tick, quantum-based scheduling. |
| Ring 3 user mode | ✅ | ELF entry via `iretq`. |
| ELF loader | ✅ | Loads PT_LOAD segments at linked virtual addresses. |
| `spawn` | 🧪 | Used by shell `run <prog>` and integration-tested. |
| `fork` | 🧪 | Deep-copy implementation, simplified semantics. |
| `execve` | 🧪 | Replaces current address space, simplified. |
| `wait4` / `wait` | 🧪 | Yield-polling, no precise child PID semantics. |
| Thread/process reaping | 🧪 | Dead TCBs/stacks are deferred-reaped from a safe stack; user page-table frames are still leaked. |
| Per-process FD tables | 🧪 | Each TCB has its own FD table; `fork` shallow-copies entries. Lifetime/inheritance semantics remain simplified. |

## Filesystems

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| VFS mount table | ✅ | Longest-prefix mount matching. |
| `readdir` / `mkdir` / `unlink` / `rename` / `stat` | ✅ | Generic VFS ops + matching syscalls (`100..105`). |
| USTAR initrd | ✅ | Read-only root with user ELFs. |
| DevFS | ✅ | `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`. |
| `tmpfs` | ✅ | Writable in-memory `/tmp`, supports `unlink` and `truncate`. |
| Tiny diskfs | ✅ | Persistent `/disk` (8 files × 4 KiB, AHCI port 0). |
| **FAT32 — full** | ✅ | `/fat`: subdirs, **LFN (UCS-2 read+write)**, mkdir/rmdir/unlink/rename/truncate, FSInfo, FAT date/time stamps. |
| **ext2 — full** | ✅ | `/ext2`: mounts existing Linux-mkfs images **and** formats blank disks in-kernel.  Direct + single/double/triple indirect blocks; mkdir/rmdir/unlink/rename; cross-OS round-trip verified with `debugfs`. |
| buffer cache | 🧪 | Buffer cache layer for block I/O caching and synchronization. |
| exFAT | 🚧 | skeleton |
| NTFS | 🚧 | skeleton |
| ext4 | 🚧 | experimental ext4-like |

|---|---:|---|
| Console/file I/O | ✅ | `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`. |
| Process basics | 🧪 | `getpid`, `exit`, `spawn`, `fork`, `execve`, `wait4`. |

## Storage and USB

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| AHCI detection/init | ✅/🧪 | Controller/port setup works in QEMU AHCI. |
| AHCI sector read/write | ✅/🧪 | DMA READ/WRITE self-test passes on the QEMU AHCI test disk. |
| UHCI controller | ✅/🧪 | Controller + port + CONTROL/BULK TD/QH transfers used by MSC. |
| OHCI controller | 🧪 | Detection/init/root-port reset plus ED/TD control, bulk and interrupt scheduling works in QEMU for HID/MSC. |
| EHCI controller | 🧪 | Detection/init/root-port reset plus async qTD control/bulk scheduling works in QEMU for high-speed MSC. Periodic interrupt and split transactions are pending. |
| xHCI controller | 🧪 | QEMU xHCI slot/address/device-context setup, endpoint contexts, command/event rings, control/bulk/interrupt transfer rings are implemented for HID/MSC. |
| USB device enumeration | 🧪 | UHCI/OHCI/EHCI/xHCI devices are enumerated through standard requests/controller-specific address setup. |
| USB HID keyboard/mouse | 🧪 | Boot Protocol/generic keyboards and pointer devices work through UHCI, OHCI, xHCI and high-speed EHCI polling; generic HID parser handles keyboard reports and mouse/tablet pointer reports (QEMU `usb-kbd`/`usb-mouse`/`usb-tablet` tested). EHCI full/low-speed split transactions remain future work. |
| USB hubs | 🧪 | Standard hub descriptor/status, port power/reset and downstream child enumeration work in QEMU, including xHCI route-string addressing for devices behind a hub. |
| USB hotplug monitor | 🧪 | Polling monitor scans root ports and known hubs, marks removed records and dynamically attaches HID and MSC class drivers for newly enumerated devices. QEMU xHCI HID and MSC attach/detach are integration-tested. |
| USB Mass Storage | 🧪 | Bulk-Only/SCSI path works through UHCI, OHCI, high-speed EHCI and xHCI in QEMU, including runtime hotplug attach/read/detach. Active media is exposed through `/usb` via usbfs (`info`, `sector0.bin`, `disk.img`) and FAT32 superfloppy/partition root files are auto-detected read-only under `/usb/fat`. |

## Wireless and Bluetooth

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Bluetooth HCI protocol | 🚧 | HCI commands/events implemented; depends on USB transport. |

## Highest-priority gaps

1. Finish full address-space/page-table reaping for exited user processes.
2. Extend user-copy into a fault-recovering uaccess layer and audit remaining kernel-internal callers.
3. Complete USB bulk/control transfer paths across OHCI/EHCI/xHCI.
4. Make scheduling SMP-aware or explicitly keep APs disabled in normal configs.
5. Enforce strict user ELF segment permissions and add user `mmap` / `munmap`.
6. Tighten FD inheritance/lifetime semantics around `fork`, `execve` and process exit.
